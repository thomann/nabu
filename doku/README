This is Nabu.

you have to read the source-code

For the Installation you have to make sure that following
JAr-Files are visible for the webapp:
- commons-beanutils.jar
- commons-digester.jar
- commons-fileupload-1.0.jar

The files are already in ${TOMCAT}/server/lib, so you can place symbolic links to
these files in ${TOMCAT}/shared/lib .

you have to append the Attributes

	swallowOutput="true" followLinks="true"

to the Context-Tag in ${TOMCAT}/Catalina/localhost/nabu.xml .

Now we need symbolic links in ${Nabu}/web/WEB-INF/uploadvocs:

- voc.xml -> ${Nabu}/etc/voc.xml
- vocs -> ${Nabu}/vocs/data/

Enjoy learning,
Yours
